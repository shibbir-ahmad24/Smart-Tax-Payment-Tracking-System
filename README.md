# Smart Tax Payment Tracking System

### **Problem**

Tax payment tracking is often cumbersome and prone to errors due to the manual handling of records. Organizations and individuals struggle to keep up with multiple due dates, making it difficult to manage payments efficiently. This leads to missed deadlines, penalties, and an overall lack of transparency in tax-related transactions.


### **Solution**

To address these challenges, the **Smart-Tax-Payment-Tracking-System** was developed as a dynamic web application using the Python Flask framework. This system automates and streamlines the tax payment process by offering the following features:
-	**Home Page:** A user-friendly interface that serves as the entry point for all functionalities.
-	**Retrieve All Tax Payment Records:** Users can view all tax payments along with their due dates, enabling easy tracking of all pending and completed payments.
-	**Retrieve Records by Due Date:** The system allows users to fetch specific tax payment records based on a selected due date.
-	**Insert New Records:** Users can easily add new tax payment records into the system.
-	**Update Records:** Existing tax payment records can be updated to reflect changes or corrections.
-	**Delete Records:** Unnecessary or incorrect records can be deleted from the database, keeping the system clean and up-to-date.
